# Roadmap — `pesto`

Fast, lean Usenet poster in Rust. Inspired by `nyuu`, with only the essentials.
Each phase must leave the program in a working, testable state.

---

## Completed ✅

| Phase | Topic |
|-------|-------|
| 0 | Foundation — workspace, CLI skeleton, config structs, logging |
| 1 | yEnc encoder — `encode_into`, CRC32, segmentation, headers |
| 2 | Basic NNTP — TCP connection, `POST`, `240` response |
| 3 | TLS & Auth — `rustls`, `AUTHINFO USER/PASS`, env-var credentials |
| 4 | Concurrent posting — connection pool, MPSC work queue, Ctrl-C |
| 5 | NZB generation — XML writer, Message-ID capture, file grouping |
| 6 | Config file — TOML load, CLI-override merge, multi-group |
| 7 | PAR2 foundation — GF(2¹⁶), Cauchy matrix, packet serialization |
| 8 | PAR2 advanced — MD5 hashing, single-pass parity, AVX2/SSSE3 SIMD |
| 9 | Local archive & obfuscation — RAR/7z, filename randomisation, passwords |
| 10 | Metadata & hooks — `.nfo` generation, post-hooks, Newznab, Discord |
| 11 | Error resilience — retry/backoff, resume state file, STAT verification |
| 12 | Performance — double-buffered reader, buffer pool, Rayon, rate limiting |
| 13 | Polish & UI — ANSI multi-bar, JSON-L mode, setup wizard, sparklines |
| 20 | Modularisation — split wizard, TUI, PAR2 worker, config into sub-modules |
| 21a | Cargo workspace — `parmesan` extracted to `crates/parmesan` |
| 21b | API decoupling — removed NNTP terminology, generic `Read`-based API |
| 21c | Benchmarking — micro-benchmarks in library, `#[inline]` tuning, docs |

## In Progress

### Phase 21d — Publish `parmesan` to crates.io

- [ ] Version the library independently from `pesto`.
- [ ] Publish `parmesan-par2` to crates.io.
- [ ] Switch `pesto` to depend on the published crate (or keep workspace path).

See [`crates/parmesan/ROADMAP.md`](crates/parmesan/ROADMAP.md) for the full
`parmesan` roadmap.

---

## Next — Phase 22+: Complete PAR2 Tooling

The resource/geometry flags from the original Phase 22 plan are **already
implemented**. The focus now is on verify/repair, input flexibility, volume
layout control, and documentation.

Details live in [`crates/parmesan/ROADMAP.md`](crates/parmesan/ROADMAP.md).

---

## Phase 23 — Interactive TUI (Ratatui)

### 23a — Dashboard layout
- [ ] Replace current ANSI output with a `ratatui` layout.
- [ ] Tabs: `Progress`, `Logs`, `Connections`, `PAR2 Status`.
- [ ] Real-time throughput graph (`Canvas` or `Sparkline` widget).

### 23b — Interactive controls
- [ ] Pause/resume upload via keyboard.
- [ ] Adjust connection count at runtime.
- [ ] Scrollable, filterable log buffer.

## Phase 32 — Future Ideas (Unscheduled)

Concepts to evaluate later. Not committed to any timeline.

| Idea | Summary |
|------|---------|
| RAM auto-cap | Cap buffer pools based on available system memory to prevent OOM |
| Dynamic connection scaling | Reduce connections under memory or TCP pressure |
| CPU topology awareness | Tune `rayon` pool to physical vs logical core count |
| Disk pre-flight | Verify free space before compression/PAR2 starts |
| In-memory mode | Skip temp files for small payloads that fit in RAM |
| `O_DIRECT` reads | Bypass page cache on Linux for huge files |
| `mmap` fast-path | `mmap` + `MADV_SEQUENTIAL` for massive file reads |
| Adaptive buffering | Grow/shrink buffer pool based on upload/read speed delta |
